## method returning wrong number ? 
#### Dania Santiago [student]
<span style="font-size:larger;">♡ </span> Hello! I have been having issues with one of my method (totalCost()). It is supposed to return the total cost of all the items in my basket, however, it is only returning the price of the last item I added to the basket.  
![image]()
In the screenshot that I provided, I expected the total cost would be 2200. However, the return is simply only 600 please help. I don’t know what what wrong. I also included the implementation of my basket for reference!

Hi dania! I think you should look into the initialization of your varibles! ( hint: consider checking inside the for loop).

I really enjoyed learning about VIM since I had heard about it before but I had never had actual exposure to it. It was nice seeing that VIM tutor was something that was implemented into the terminal to facilitate learning about it. I also loved making the grading script since I was not aware of how much abstraction you could do with it. Instead of running a bunch of comamnds you could do one.
